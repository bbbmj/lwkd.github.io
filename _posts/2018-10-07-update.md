## Community Meeting Summary

The biggest news from the [community meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) is the election of the three new open Steering Committee positions.  Our new & returning SC members are: Davanum Srinivas ("dims"), Aaron Crickenberger, and Timothy St. Clair.

Also, note that the [Contributor Summit Seattle](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/2018/12-contributor-summit) registration is separate from Kubecon Seattle registration, and contributors should RSVP now.

The rest of the meeting was taken up by the [1.12 Release Retrospective](http://bit.ly/k8s112-retro).  Highlights of the retro include:

* successfully recruited more Release Team members from Asia and Europe, partly by having multiple meeting times
* were able to reduce the number of labels & steps required for merge and code freeze
* successfully moved to Tide for PR merge during code freeze
* the process of adding features to a release, and tracking them from one release to another, still needs an overhaul

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, October 23rd**

Aish Sundar, the new Release Lead, said [1.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.13) will be a "short release" (10 weeks), so SIGs should scale down their enhancement plans. Planned code freeze is November 15th, targeting a final release on December 3rd (before Kubecon Seattle).

Major changes already happening in 1.13 include deprecating support for etcd2 and upgrading go to 1.11.1 (see below).

Pengfei Ni released [1.12.1](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-dev/h_SoRAyzmDg/discussion) on October 5th, with the first set of fixes for 1.12.

## Featured PRs

### [#69310: Remove etcd2 storage backend](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69310)

Etcd 2 has been deprecated since 1.9 was released last last year, but the time has come to bid it a final farewell. If you have any old test clusters hiding in a dark corner that are still using v2, make sure to get them migrated soon.

### [#69386: Update to go1.11.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69386)

Jumping from Go 1.10.4 to 1.11.1, this brings some new language features and optimizations. Check out [the Go 1.11 release notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.11) for more info on those changes, though it will probably be a while before we see too many changes.

### [#69464: Move each kubectl command to a separate directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69464)

The kubectl cleanup train continues to roll forward, this time splitting kubectl commands into their own packages. This dramatically reduces the time to run tests or similar on a single command. If you've been looking for a good excuse to hack on some kubectl commands, it's now easier than ever!

### [#68310: Moving the cloudprovider interface to staging](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68310)

Another long-term project making progress, the main cloud provider interface code has been split out to `k8s.io/cloud-provider`. The specific implementations haven't been moved yet, but anything touching cloud provider data types will need to be updated.

Similarly, the [client bootstrap code in `client-go` has been moved to its own repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67356).

## Other Merges

* Multiple improvements for certificate handling, including [allowing different PEM formats](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69536), [fixing clientCA in delegating auth](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69430), and letting [kubeadm join using old certs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69328)
* You can [now use just one file](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69426) for both Kubeadm init and join configs  
* Optional CSIDriver fields [are optional](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69331)
* Kubeadm config now has [v1beta1 API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69289)
* AttachVolumeLimit is [on by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69225)
* Control scheduler and controller CPU requests [using ENV](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68823)
* The code-generator will [stop lowercasing everything](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68484)

## Deprecated

* [Etcd2 support is deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69310) in 1.13alpha.
* Parallelize has been [replaced with ParallelizeUntil](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68403), at least until that is replaced in turn (probably in 1.14)

* [golang to 1.11.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69386)
