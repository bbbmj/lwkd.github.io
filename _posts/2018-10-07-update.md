## Community Meeting Summary


## Release Schedule


## Featured PRs

### [#69310: Remove etcd2 storage backend](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69310)

Etcd 2 has been deprecated since 1.9 was released last last year, but the time has come to bid it a final farewell. If you have any old test clusters hiding in a dark corner that are still using v2, make sure to get them migrated soon.

### [#69386: Update to go1.11.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69386)

Jumping from Go 1.10.4 to 1.11.1, this brings some new language features and optimizations. Check out [the Go 1.11 release notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.11) for more info on those changes, though it will probably be a while before we see too many changes.

### [#69464: Move each kubectl command to a separate directory](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69464)

The kubectl cleanup train continues to roll forward, this time splitting kubectl commands into their own packages. This dramatically reduces the time to run tests or similar on a single command. If you've been looking for a good excuse to hack on some kubectl commands, it's now easier than ever!

### [#68310: Moving the cloudprovider interface to staging](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68310)

Another long-term project making progress, the main cloud provider interface code has been split out to `k8s.io/cloud-provider`. The specific implementations haven't been moved yet, but anything touching cloud provider data types will need to be updated.

Similarly, the [client bootstrap code in `client-go` has been moved to its own repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/67356).
