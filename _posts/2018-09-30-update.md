## Community Meeting Summary


## Release Schedule


## Featured PRs

### [#65135: Add "MayRunAs" value among other GroupStrategies](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65135)

A nice feature merge now that freeze is behind us, this adds a `MayRunAs` group strategy for volumes and containers in the PodSecurityPolicy system.

### [#68754: Make service environment variables optional ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68754)

A nice bit of forward motion away from old Docker-y defaults, Kubernetes will no longer populate the `docker --link`-style environment variables by default, in favor of using DNS-based service lookup through kube-dns or CoreDNS. It can be turned back on if needed using the `kubernetes.io/service-environment-variables` annotation.

### [#68752: Start synchronizing pods after network is ready](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68752)

A small PR which should be nice for people bouncing kubelets a lot during tests, this should prevent pods from coming up before the network is ready.

### [#68330: ignore .git dirs when executing gofmt](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/68330)

Another (very) small PR, but should be a nice speedup for running gofmt.

### [#69055: Kubeadm remove v1alpha2 api](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/69055)

And finally another nice bit of momentum from the Kubeadm team, removing the alpha2 API. Existing kubeadm config objects can be upgraded using `kubeadm config migrate`.
