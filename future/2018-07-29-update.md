## Featured PRs

### [#66518: add missing OrDie variant for dynamic client construction](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66518)

A small change, but nice to have for a lot of common cases, this adds a
`NewForConfigOrDie` for the Go client library. This has already resulted in some
[code cleanup](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66299) and will
probably allow similar changes in other test scripts and other management tools.

### [#66296: Add flake-reporting utility to testing framework](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66296)

In an effort to track, and eventually fix, inconsistent e2e tests there is now
an API (`RecordFlakeIfError`) for writing a flake-specific log entry if an e2e
test failed unexpectedly.

### [#58755: Use probe based plugin watcher mechanism in Device Manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/58755)

In development for a long time and finally merged, this means the kubelet will
scan for plugins in a given folder. This (hopefully) moves towards unifying the
plugin management layers between device plugins, CNI plugins, etc.

### [#66506: Remove kubelet docker shared pid flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/66506)

The deprecated `--docker-disable-shared-pid` kubelet flag has been removed in
favor of the `ShareProcessNamespace` pod API. If you're using shared PID namespaces
for any testing, make sure you update to the new system.

### [#63955: Taint node when initializing node](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63955)

This fixes a small race condition when booting a new, tainted node. Fortunately
an easy fix this time around, but a great reminder to be vigilant about
concurrent operations whenever possible.
